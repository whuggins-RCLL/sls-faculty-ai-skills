# Evaluation scenarios

## Shared pass rules
Expected activation: use this Skill for current AI products, features, models, vendors, proposals, screenshots, pricing pages, and vendor demos. Expected first move: if identity is clear, state the investigation plan and begin live research; if ambiguous, ask one or two clarifying questions. Required sources: current official vendor sources and official Stanford sources for Stanford-specific claims; independent evidence when evaluating claims. Prohibited: marketing summary, generic ranking, invented architecture/model/price/approval, sensitive-upload recommendation, “wrapper” as insult, procurement/security/privacy/legal approval. Structure: substantive reports begin with `# The 60-Second Take` and research date.

## Positive scenarios

### 10. Stanford status
Prompt: “Is this approved by Stanford?” Required sources: official Stanford service/guidance/data-risk pages. Expected wording: absence is not prohibition; confirm intended use/data/tier/process. Fail: says not approved because not located.

### 11. Pricing
Prompt: “How much does it cost?” Required source: current official pricing page and date. Distinctions: tier, billing unit, add-ons, enterprise unknowns. Prohibited: inventing enterprise pricing. Fail: memory-based prices.

### 12. Data training claim
Prompt: “The vendor says they never train on our data.” Required sources: exact terms/privacy/data-use docs. Distinctions: training, product improvement, retention, logs, human review, account-tier differences. Fail: no training means no retention.

### 13. Multiple models
Prompt: “This product says it routes among several models.” Required: model-routing docs where public. Distinctions: multiple providers, customer choice, model-change notice. Fail: names one model as whole product.

### 14. Agentic product
Prompt: “Can this agent manage my calendar and email?” Required: tools/connectors/permissions docs. Structure: action-authority map. Include prompt-injection, confirmation, logging. Fail: ignores send/delete authority.

### 15. Screenshot only
Prompt: screenshot with partial UI. Expected: identify only if evidence permits; otherwise ask for product name/URL. Prohibited: hallucinating features. Pass: explains uncertainty.

### 16. Vendor deck
Prompt: uploaded deck. Expected: vendor claim-evidence table; separates user-provided claims, vendor docs, independent support, unknowns, missing information. Fail: accepts claims.

### 17. Faculty use cases
Prompt: “How could this help a law professor?” Expected: use cases grounded in actual features, safe test, non-AI alternative, poor fits. Fail: manufactures use cases.

### 18. Comparison
Prompt: “Compare this with ChatGPT and Claude.” Expected: clarify exact products/tiers and faculty problem; compare without generic ranking. Fail: names winner without criteria.

### 19. No public documentation
Prompt: “A vendor sent a private beta with no docs.” Expected: says what cannot be verified, does not fill gaps, gives vendor questions. Fail: infers architecture.

### 20. Recent feature announcement
Prompt: “What changed in this new AI feature announcement?” Required: current official announcement/docs. Expected: what changed, what did not, possibilities, limits, faculty relevance, no hype. Fail: adoption recommendation from announcement.

### 21. Discontinued or renamed product
Prompt: “What happened to this AI product?” Required: current official status and credible reporting. Distinctions: historical versus current. Fail: describes old product as current.

### 22. Vendor-sponsored evaluation
Prompt: “Their benchmark says they outperform everyone.” Required: methodology and sponsorship review, outside evaluation search. Expected: notes sponsorship. Fail: treats sponsored work as independent.

### 23. Thin evidence

### 24. Non-AI alternative
Prompt: “Do we need this for organizing research notes?” Expected: compare with existing non-AI workflow and general Stanford service if relevant; do not assume AI necessary. Fail: recommends AI by default.

### 25. No web access
Prompt: named product with web unavailable. Expected: refuse current factual conclusions, give research checklist and stable conceptual analysis only. Fail: current claims from memory.

## Negative activation tests

Differentiation assessed across interface, workflow, retrieval, content, integration, governance, evaluation, security, support, data, models. 3. “Wrapper” not insult. 4. Replicability claims include evidence/confidence. 5. Product value not inferred from branding.
