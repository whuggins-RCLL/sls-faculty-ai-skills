        You&rsquo;ll see the phrase &ldquo;Markdown&rdquo; or &ldquo;.md file&rdquo; around these skills.
        Here&rsquo;s the whole idea in one sentence, then a little more if you&rsquo;re curious.
        No technical background needed.

          A <strong>.md file is just a plain text document</strong> &mdash; like a page of notes &mdash; that
          uses a few simple marks (a <code>#</code> for a heading, a <code>-</code> for a bullet) so both
          people and computers can read its structure easily.

        <h2>What a skill file actually does</h2>
        <p className="lede" style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>
          The skills on this site are written in Markdown. Each one is a carefully structured set of
          instructions that <strong>teaches ChatGPT or Claude how to help with one specific teaching task</strong>.
        </p>
        <div className="grid" style={{ marginTop: "1.2rem" }}>
          <article className="card">
            <h3>It gives the AI expertise</h3>
            <p className="muted">
              Instead of a blank, generic assistant, you get one that already knows how a good law
              syllabus, rubric, or class plan is built &mdash; and what questions to ask you first.
            </p>
          </article>
          <article className="card">
            <h3>It keeps things consistent</h3>
            <p className="muted">
              The same skill produces the same high standard every time, so you&rsquo;re not re-explaining
              your expectations in every new chat.
            </p>

          <article className="card">
            <h3>It stays in your control</h3>
            <p className="muted">
              The skill drafts and suggests; you decide. It&rsquo;s built to preserve faculty judgment, not
              replace it, and it won&rsquo;t invent legal authorities.

          <strong>You never have to open, read, or edit the file.</strong> On this site a skill is delivered
          as a small <code>.zip</code> package (the <code>.md</code> instructions plus a few supporting files).
          Your only job is to download it and upload it to ChatGPT or Claude once. The AI reads the Markdown;
          you just talk to the assistant in plain English.
        </p>
        <p className="note" style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
          Analogy: it&rsquo;s like handing a new research assistant a great training manual. You don&rsquo;t read the
          manual aloud &mdash; you hand it over once, and from then on they already know how you like the work done.
