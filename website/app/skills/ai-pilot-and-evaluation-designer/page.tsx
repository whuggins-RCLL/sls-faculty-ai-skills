          <h2>What it does</h2>
          <p>
            Helps faculty move from a polished vendor demo, a five-minute experiment, a prototype, a claim,
            or a proposed workflow to a disciplined, limited, documented pilot that produces evidence an
            authorized decision-maker can actually use.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article className="card">
          <h2>When to use it</h2>
          <p>
            Once a problem and a candidate AI use are defined well enough to test. For deciding whether AI
            belongs at all, start with the Problem-to-AI Use Case Studio; to test one behavior, use the
            Capability and Failure Lab.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article className="card">
          <h2>Demonstration is not a pilot</h2>
          <p>
            It keeps four states distinct: a demonstration shows a result once; a capability lab documents a
            behavior; a pilot tests whether a complete workflow performs acceptably under representative
            conditions; deployment is continuing use. A good pilot result is evidence, not approval.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article className="card">
          <h2>Decision first</h2>
          <p>
            Every pilot states the decision it will support before any test is designed, and rejects vague
            purposes like &ldquo;see how it goes.&rdquo; The pilot question names the users, task, materials,
            system, baseline, and acceptable limits.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article className="card">
          <h2>Evidence discipline</h2>
          <p>
            Establishes a baseline; builds representative and difficult test sets; sets success and failure
            criteria before results; counts omissions, not just visible errors; and measures the realistic
            human-review burden so time &ldquo;savings&rdquo; are not illusory.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article className="card">
          <h2>Critical failures are not averaged away</h2>
          <p>
            Fabricated authority, restricted-data exposure, or an unauthorized action cannot be offset by
            strong average performance. A single critical failure caps the decision at revise-and-retest or
            stop.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article className="card">
          <h2>Data, permissions, and agents</h2>
          <p>
            Defaults to public or synthetic material, least privilege, and no consequential actions. Agent
            pilots begin in simulation or a sandbox and separate read, draft, send, and delete. The Skill
            identifies data and institutional questions; it does not authorize data use.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article className="card">
          <h2>Stop conditions and change control</h2>
          <p>
            Every full pilot defines pause, stop, escalate, and resume triggers, and records the exact
            product, model, tier, and dates so a mid-pilot update triggers a rerun rather than silently
            invalidating results.

        <article className="card">
          <h2>Decision-ready outputs</h2>
          <p>
            Produces readiness briefs, charters, full protocols, test sets, scoring rubrics, failure logs,
            review-burden reports, comparison matrices, and a decision memo using only calibrated labels.

            This Skill is in active development; the downloadable ZIP is coming soon. It does not approve
            products, certify security or accessibility, replace legal review, or authorize deployment.
            A successful pilot is evidence for a decision, not institutional authorization.

          <h2>Current research</h2>
          <p>
            Pilots that depend on current products, models, tiers, or Stanford services trigger live web
            research with a research-checked date. The Skill does not state current product facts from memory
            or infer approval from the absence of a public listing.
